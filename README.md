## About Me

I'm a Doctoral Candidate with the Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics at Aalto University, Finland.

I'm interested in statistical signal processing, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. My recent publications have been in the topics of sparse linear regression and regularized covariance matrix estimation in high-dimensional and low sample size setting.

I'm also a musician and guitar teacher. Checkout my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/elias-raninen) for music.
