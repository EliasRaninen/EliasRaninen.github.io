I'm a Doctoral Candidate with the Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics at Aalto University, Finland. I'm interested in statistical signal processing, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. My recent publications have been in the topics of sparse regression and high-dimensional regularized covariance matrix estimation.
