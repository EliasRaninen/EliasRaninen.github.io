## About Me

I'm a Doctoral Candidate in [Prof. Esa Ollila's](http://users.spa.aalto.fi/esollila/) research group with the [Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland.

I'm interested in statistical signal processing, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. My recent research has been focusing on theory and methods for high-dimensional and low sample size problems in the topics of sparse linear regression and regularized covariance matrix estimation. You can find more about my research from the links provided in the [Publications](./publications.md) page. Many of my articles also include code, which can be downloaded from my [GitHub](https://github.com/EliasRaninen) page.
