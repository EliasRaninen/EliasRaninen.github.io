## About Me

I'm a researcher in statistical signal processing at Nokia Bell Labs, Espoo,
Finland. My research focuses on algorithm development and machine learning
methods for physical-layer signal processing in modern wireless communications
systems.  Before joining Bell Labs, I received the D.Sc. (Tech.) degree in
signal processing technology from Aalto University, Espoo, Finland, in 2022. My
doctoral thesis on high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation received the
Aalto University Doctoral Thesis Award in 2023. I hold both a B.Sc. (Tech.) and
a M.Sc. (Tech.) in electrical engineering from Aalto University, Espoo, Finland,
as well as a Bachelor of Culture and Arts in pop and jazz music from Metropolia
University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki. My interests include statistical
signal processing, machine learning, wireless communications, and playing guitar
and jazz music.

You can find more about my research from the links provided in the
[Publications](./publications.md) page. Many of my articles also include code,
which can be downloaded from my [GitHub](https://github.com/EliasRaninen) page.
