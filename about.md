## About Me

I'm currently a Radio Research Engineer/Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs, Espoo, Finland.
My research focuses on machine learning methods for wireless communications.
I received the D.Sc. (Tech.) degree in signal processing technology from Aalto
University, Espoo, Finland, in 2022. My doctoral thesis developed theory and methods 
for high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation (more info below). I hold both a
B.Sc. (Tech.) and a M.Sc. (Tech.) in electrical engineering from Aalto University, 
Espoo, Finland, as well as a Bachelor of Culture and Arts degree in pop and jazz 
music from Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland. My interests 
include jazz music, statistical signal processing, machine learning, and wireless 
communications.

You can find more about my research from the links provided in the
[Publications](./publications.md) page. Many of my articles also include code,
which can be downloaded from my [GitHub](https://github.com/EliasRaninen) page.

## Doctoral research

My doctoral research centered on theoretical and applied research in the
intersection of signal processing, multivariate statistics, and machine
learning. I worked in [Prof. Esa Ollila's](http://users.spa.aalto.fi/esollila/)
research group with the [Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland. The focus of my research was on advanced
learning methods and optimized algorithms for estimation and classification.
Specifically, I developed theory and methods for high-dimensional covariance 
matrix estimation for low sample size problems.

In statistical data analysis and machine learning problems, it is important to
be able to measure and quantify the degree of associations between the
variables. This information is given by the covariance matrix, which is a
building block for many important techniques in statistics and machine learning,
such as in classification and clustering algorithms. Covariance matrix
estimation methods developed for the traditional data regime often perform
poorly in high-dimensional low sample size settings. A common approach to solve
the problem is to use some variable selection or dimension reduction technique.

In my doctoral research, I have developed regularized covariance matrix
estimation methods for high-dimensional single class and multiclass problems.
Regularization refers to incorporating additional or prior information into the
problem, which can be expressed in the form of structure in the unknown
parameters, which can entail sparsity, low rank, or the parameter space can be
constrained to lie on a manifold. Using these tools and techniques, we have been
able to derive various computationally efficient and accurate estimation
methods, whose usefulness has been demonstrated using real world data in
problems such as classification or portfolio optimization in finance.
