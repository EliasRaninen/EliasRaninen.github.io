## What's New?

* (November 29, 2025) I attended the 33rd European Signal Processing Conference 2025 (EUSIPCO) in Palermo, Italy, 8-12 September. I co-authored with Prof. Esa Ollila and Dr. Xavier Mestre on the paper [*Approach to beamforming minimizing the signal power estimation error*](https://eusipco2025.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/0002382.pdf), which studies beamformers in terms of their signal estimation error, signal power estimation error, and signal power estimation bias. A feature of Capon and MMSE beamformers is that they either overestimate or underestimate the signal power. To address this issue, we propose Capon+ beamformer that strikes a favorable balance between signal estimation error, signal power estimation error, and signal power bias. We have recently also extended the paper to a journal version, which can be found from [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16767).

* (September 20, 2024) It was a pleasure to attend the 32nd European Signal Processing Conference 2024 (EUSIPCO) in Lyon, France, August 26-30, where I presented the paper [*Oracle approximating shrinkage covariance matrix estimators for complex elliptical distribution*](https://eurasip.org/Proceedings/Eusipco/Eusipco2024/pdfs/0002717.pdf). The paper generalizes the popular [*Oracle Approximating Shrinkage (OAS)*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5484583) method by Chen et al. (2010) to complex elliptical (including complex Gaussian) distributions and robust shrinkage M-estimators of scatter matrix.
  
* (March 14, 2023) I feel honored and grateful to have received the [*Aalto University Doctoral Thesis Award 2023*](https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/school-of-electrical-engineering-celebrated-excellence-and-achievements-of-2022).

* (September 2, 2022) My blog post [*Signaali, kohina ja pari muuttujaa*](https://tekniikanedistamissaatio.fi/signaali-kohina-ja-pari-muuttujaa/) for the [Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion](https://tekniikanedistamissaatio.fi/en/), which awarded me a scholarship in 2019. 

* (August 8, 2022) I'm excited to start in my new job as a Radio Research Engineer/Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs, Espoo, Finland.

* (May 27, 2022) I successfully defended my thesis [*Contributions to theory and estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices*](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/114219). The thesis proposes theory and methods for covariance matrix estimation, when the sample size is smaller than or comparable to the dimension of the data.

* (October 6, 2021) I delivered a talk [*On high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation for multiple classes*](https://sites.google.com/view/slsipworkshop/home/technicalprogram) at [*Statistical Learning for Signal and Image Processing (SLSIP) Workshop*](https://sites.google.com/view/slsipworkshop/home), Rüdesheim am Rhein, Germany, October 6th -- 8th, 2021.

* (December 18, 2020) Prof. Esa Ollila delivered a talk about our work [*Linear Pooling of Sample Covariance Matrices*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665347) in a virtual seminar at DataIA institute of University of Paris-Saclay.
