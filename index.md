## Welcome

I'm a Doctoral Candidate in [Prof. Esa Ollila's](http://users.spa.aalto.fi/esollila/) research group with the [Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland. Read more about me [here](./about.md).

## What's New?

* (On May 27, 2022) I successfully defended my thesis [*Contributions to theory and estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices*](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/114219). The thesis proposes theory and methods for covariance matrix estimation, when the sample size is small or comparable to the dimension of the data.

* (On Oct. 6, 2021) I delivered a talk [*On high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation for multiple classes*](https://sites.google.com/view/slsipworkshop/home/technicalprogram) at [*Statistical Learning for Signal and Image Processing (SLSIP) Workshop*](https://sites.google.com/view/slsipworkshop/home), RÃ¼desheim am Rhein, Germany, October 6th -- 8th, 2021.

* (On Dec. 18, 2020) Prof. Esa Ollila delivered a talk about our work [*Linear Pooling of Sample Covariance Matrices*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9665347) in a virtual seminar at DataIA institute of University of Paris-Saclay.
