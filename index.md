## About Me

I'm a Doctoral Candidate in [Prof. Esa Ollila's](http://users.spa.aalto.fi/esollila/) research group with the [Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland.

I'm interested in statistical signal processing, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. My recent research has been focusing on theory and methods for high-dimensional and low sample size problems in the topics of sparse linear regression and regularized covariance matrix estimation. You can find doi links to my papers from the [Publications](./publications.md) page.
