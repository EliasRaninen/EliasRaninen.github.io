Once in a while, I perform at gigs in the capital area of Helsinki as a freelancer. Before I started with signal processing, I studied music at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, from where I hold a Bachelor's degree in pop and jazz music education. I enjoy listening and playing various styles, but jazz music is dearest and nearest to my heart. If you're interested, you can hear some of my playing from
my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/elias-raninen) page.
